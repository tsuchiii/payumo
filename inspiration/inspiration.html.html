						<h4>I have been following this artist since I was in elementary school when I started doodling. 
								I have seen how their art progressed through the years, inspiring me to do the same.  
								Most of my art or things I make are typically monochrome because of this.</h4>

						<h4>I have been following this artist since I was in high school. 
								I love their art and see how they portray love and express it in such a beautiful manner. 
								I do not draw people, but this inspires me to start even simple sketches because I want to portray the same sentiments. </h4>

						<h4>I have been following this artist recently, and I am a huge sucker for sceneries. 
								I love aesthetic backgrounds and this person inspires me to start digital art. </h4>
